Statement

Chef is new to programming. One day while he was playing with an Array A of N integers, he found a happy subset. A subset of an array A is said to be happy if it has exactly L elements and the absolute difference between Maximum and Minimum number of the subset is at most K.

Input Format

The first line contains integers N, L and K.
The next line has N space separated integers.

Output Format

Print the number of happy subset possible using the given Array. As the answer could be large, print it Modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 5*10^5

1 <= K <= N

1 <= A[i], X <= 10^9


Note - that it may be possible that the maximum and minimum element of a subset may be equal to each other. 2 subsets are considered different if they differ in atleast one index picked from the array A.

Sample Input

5 3 5

1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output

10

Explanation

One of the ways to pick a happy subset is : [5, 3, 1] . For this array, each happy subset of size 3 is a valid pick.
